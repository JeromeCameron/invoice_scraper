####  Note
This package is tailored to ***work with a specific invoice layout***. 
If your invoices use a different structure, the code will need to 
be modified to adapt to your format. To customize the scraper for 
other layouts, you'll need to update the parsing logic in the 
code to match the unique structure of your invoices.
